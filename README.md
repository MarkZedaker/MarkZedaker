- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkZedaker
- 👀 I’m interested in web design. I learned web design in the 90's and, while I've kept on on things a little bit, I really feel like the world of web design has passed me by. I'm trying to update my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning with The Odin Project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects. I feel like I'm learning from scratch, so I don't think I'll be collaborating very much.
- 📫 How to reach me: mark.zedaker at gmail dot com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Mark is a philosopher first, and has developed philosophies of conviction, as well as a theory of heroes and heroism.
